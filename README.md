# CRUD
Functional application CRUD using PHP and Vue.JS
Still need to implent upload image for new visitor. 
The image is encoded but not save in the database :/ ,thats where i got stuck.
the display for error handling bugs sometimes, so still need to implement.
Overall the bassic functions is in place and working.
All the php scripts was tested using postman

Oportunitie for improvment 

-Can be add a search bar
-change the way the list is displayed
-passing the information from index.html to separate templates
-use vue components, vue Routerto scale up the application 
-after get the image uploading , probably change the updateVisitor to also be able to change the image.

#Database 
*id -ai
*name -vc 50
*surname -vc 50
*phone -vc 50
*email- vc 100
*image- blob
